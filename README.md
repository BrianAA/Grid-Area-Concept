This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Quick Start
- Run npm install
- npm start to get server going

## Note
Uses Styled components to style the grid based on inputs to the grid component. 

## Concept
Explores using grid areas instead of spans. Look at file src/utility/grid.jsx
This component is what defines the grid itself with combination of css classes of
grid-area. See (index.css for areas). 

The areas are define by passing the css syntax req. to define the area. i.e. 'a b c d' 


Any questions ask me :)
